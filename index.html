    <p>A few of my repos would have been better as web-pages/blogs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/HinTak/harfbuzz-python-demos/">harfbuzz-python-demo</a>: Drawing examples of complex (Arabic, Devanagari, Tibetan, Mogolian, etc) texts with a python script, using python's binding to Harfbuzz and FreeType
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/HinTak/RaspberryPi-Dev/">Development for the Raspberry Pi</a>: specifically on the kernel/driver side, and how <a href="https://github.com/HinTak/seeed-voicecard">my substantial enhancement fork</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/respeaker/seeed-voicecard">Seeed Studio ReSpeaker driver</a> came to be.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In 2015, I registered on github, mainly to <a href="https://github.com/HinTak/Font-Validator/">take up continuing Microsoft's Font Validator</a>, after a few months of private communication with Microsoft and Google. Microsoft eventually released <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Font-Validator/">the minimally fixed-up version</a>, while I was already working on re-implementing the removed/withheld functionalities.</p>
    <p>A few new repositories and enhancement forks of existing projects had spawned out of that effort. That includes <a href="https://github.com/HinTak/SharpFont/">SharpFont</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HinTak/mono/">mono</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HinTak/webkit-sharp/">webkit-sharp</a>, etc. The latest are <a href="https://github.com/HinTak/mono-modification/">mono-modification</a> to address code-signing issues on Mac OS X, and <a href="https://github.com/HinTak/ftx-darling/">ftx-darling</a> for trying to run Apple's Font Tool Suite on Darling.</p>
    <p>FontVal is a large effort and actively accepts donations. There are two links for donations via Paypal: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/hp-pxl-jetready/donate/">link 1</a> asks for credit card details, <a href="https://paypal.me/HinTakLeung?locale.x=en_GB">link 2</a> is Paypal to Paypal, I believe. Please <b>do not</b> use the gmail account shown on the paypal links for correspondence - e-mails to it are not checked up to a few months.
    <p>Various areas <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&q=hin-tak+leung">in the Linux Kernel I have worked on</a>, according to public records. Some past work never went upstream...
